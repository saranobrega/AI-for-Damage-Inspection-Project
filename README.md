# AI for Damage Detection Challenge

Using object detection models to detect damages in bridges. Detecting defects on a bridge surface to aid in more effective and efficient bridge inspections.  

This challenge was organized by FruitPunch AI and was developed by 2 teams of data scientists and engineers for 10 weeks. 


### Methods

1. Binary Multi-label classification and Learning Curve Analysis
   - Useful for detecting multiple instances of defects within a single image
   - Useful to provide an estimate of how many training samples are needed to have a robust model
   
   
2. Object Detection
   - Useful to get the locations of the detected defect instances within the given image
   
   
3. Multi-class Single-label classification
   - Useful for inferring the defect label of a cropped image showing a single defect
